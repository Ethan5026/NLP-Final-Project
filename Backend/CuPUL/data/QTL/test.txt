Optic O
pathway O
gliomas O
( O
OPGs O
) O
are O
diagnosed O
based O
on O
typical O
MR O
features O
and O
require O
careful O
monitoring O
with O
serial O
MRI O
. O
Reliable O
, O
serial O
radiological O
comparison O
of O
OPGs O
is O
a O
difficult O
task O
, O
where O
accuracy O
becomes O
very O
important O
for O
clinical O
decisions O
on O
treatment O
initiation O
and O
results O
. O
Current O
radiological O
methodology O
usually O
includes O
linear O
measurements O
that O
are O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
precision O
and O
reproducibility O
. O
We O
present O
a O
method O
that O
enables O
semiautomated O
segmentation O
and O
internal O
classification O
of O
OPGs O
using O
a O
novel O
algorithm O
. O
Our O
method O
begins O
with O
co O
- O
registration O
of O
the O
different O
sequences O
of O
an O
MR O
study O
so O
that O
T1 O
and O
T2 O
slices O
are O
realigned O
. O
The O
follow O
- O
up O
studies O
are O
then O
re O
- O
sliced O
according O
to O
the O
baseline O
study O
. O
The O
baseline O
tumor O
is O
segmented O
, O
with O
internal O
components O
classified O
into O
solid O
non O
- O
enhancing O
, O
solid O
- O
enhancing O
, O
and O
cystic O
components O
, O
and O
the O
volume O
is O
calculated O
. O
Tumor O
demarcation O
is O
then O
transferred O
onto O
the O
next O
study O
and O
the O
process O
repeated O
. O
Numerical O
values O
are O
correlated O
with O
clinical O
data O
such O
as O
treatment O
and O
visual O
ability O
. O
We O
have O
retrospectively O
implemented O
our O
method O
on O
24 O
MR O
studies O
of O
three O
OPG O
patients O
. O
Clinical O
case O

are O
presented O
here O
. O
The O
volumetric O
results O
have O
been O
correlated O

data O
and O
their O
implications O
are O
also O
discussed O
. O
The O
heterogeneity O

OPGs O
, O
the O
long O

, O
and O
the O
young O
age O
of O
the O

are O
all O
driving O
the O
demand O
for O
more O

This O
method O
may O
allow O
better O
understanding O

the O
